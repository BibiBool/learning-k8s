# Intro

This repository covers my journey through learning K8s, after learning Linux,
Bash Scripting and Docker.

I will start with the most basic deployment - a simple 'Hello World' app - to a
as complex as possible app to demonstrate my knowledge, understanding and
experience of deploying and debugging a K8s cluster.

Check out the devbox.json to see the list of packages that I use.
